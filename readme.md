Bluemix plugin for Eclipse for offline installation.



Instructions:-
1. Download attached zip & extract in C drive.
2. go to your Eclipse install, choose 'Help->Install New Software..', click on 'Add Repository' and choose your local repository (i.e. /tmp/eclipsetoolsforbluemix). You should then be able to install the plugin from your local repository without the need for internet access, obviously the local repository could be on a usb stick or a shared drive dependent on how you want to do the installs.
For the IBM Eclipse tools for Bluemix you will need to make sure you also check the Cloud Foundry plugins to be installed, these are included in the mirror. The Liberty Server eclipse plugin is an optional install.
